**Book version: P1.0—December 2015**

This includes examples of `Reactive Programming with RxJS` book. 

## Before We Start

We need to download `rx`

`$ npm i`

## Chapter 1 

### Footnotes

## Chapter 2

#### [Example Earthquake](https://github.com/behicsakar/reactive-programming-with-rxjs/tree/master/examples/earthquake/)

Using the concepts that we’ve covered so far in this chapter, we’ll build a web application that uses RxJS to show us where earthquakes are happening in real time. We’ll start by building a functional but naive reactive implementa- tion, and we’ll improve it as we go. The final result will look like this:

## Chapter 3

#### [Example Spaceship](https://github.com/behicsakar/reactive-programming-with-rxjs/tree/master/examples/spaceship/)

In our game, the player will move the spaceship horizontally using the mouse, and will shoot by clicking the mouse or tapping the spacebar. Our game will have four main actors: the moving star field in the background, the player’s spaceship, the enemies, and the shots from both the player and the enemies.
It will look like this:

### Small Errors Within Sample Codes on Book

~~FALSE : Rx.Observable.from(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)~~

TRUE : Rx.Observable.from([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8])   `// should be array`

FALSE "In the preceding example we create a new Subject and a source Observable that emits an integer every ~~second.~~"

TRUE  "In the preceding example we create a new Subject and a source Observable that emits an integer every **300 milisecond.**"

```
var rangeToFive = Rx.Observable.range(1, 5);
var obs1 = rangeToFive.subscribe(printValue); // 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
var obs2 = Rx.Observable
  .delay(2000)
  .flatMap(function() {
    return rangeToFive.subscribe(printValue); // 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
  });
```

FALSE : `var obs2 = Rx.Observable.delay(2000)`

TRUE : `var obs2 = Rx.Observable.just().delay(2000)`
